Purpose: Use weights to prioritize personas (e.g., 'csnp', 'vision') based on user behavior and plan data for Random Forest training.

Basic Components:
Plan features (e.g., ma_vision, csnp)

User interactions (queries, filters, pages viewed, clicks)

Persona-specific adjustments (e.g., stronger 'csnp' emphasis)

Key Points:
Weights combine plan relevance and user behavior.

Special boosts for key personas like 'csnp'.

Normalized weights ensure balanced influence.

Features + weights predict target_persona.

Random Forest Formula:  
Model: y = majority_vote(T_1(x), T_2(x), ..., T_n(x))  
Where:  
y = predicted persona  

T_i(x) = decision tree iâ€™s prediction  

x = input features (behavioral + plan + weights)  

n = number of trees
